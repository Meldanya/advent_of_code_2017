* Run Instructions
=day12.go= takes one argument; a filename to a file that contains the puzzle
input.

Example:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
go run day12.go puzzle.in
#+END_SRC

* Thought Process
** Part 1
We add all numbers that are mentioned together in a map, if they contain 0 or
the map already contain one of the previous numbers. Since we don't need to know
the paths that the programs need to take, we can simply store all program IDs
that are related to 0. 
We do the algorithm above multiple times since we might have a relation further
down that would create a relation between programs that previously weren't
related. 

** Part 2
Using the same algorithm as in part 1, we store all groups in a slice (a dynamic
array in non-go parlance). We loop through each program ID, and if a ID is
already in a previous map, we don't add that group again.
